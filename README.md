## Hi there, I'm Steve 👋🏼

I’m a software engineer on the platform team at Appshare. We mostly work on creating small apps for warehouse use.

#### I...
- 🦥 Love playing games and watching movies/tv shows
- 💪🏼 Occasionaly workout/meditate
- 🔭 Am dedicated to refining my strategic infrastructure thinking
- 💅🏼 Develop/maintain various navigational/input/display components
- 👀 Got a high focus on UX/UI/DX
- 🤝🏻 Constantly think about how to accelerate development as a team
- 🎨 Often delve into graphic design, including logos, wallpapers, and more

While my proficiency spans full-stack development, my true expertise lies in front-end development, where my skills in design, prototyping, and implementation shine.
